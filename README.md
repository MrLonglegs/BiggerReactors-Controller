# BiggerReactors-Controller
LUA Script for controlling Reactors and Turbines from the BiggerReactors Mod.

This LUA Script is written for CC: Tweaked to control virtually any number of reactors and turbines.

Just connect the everything to the Computer with their respective Ports and the program can find them automatically.

There are some variables one can adjust to their liking, but the standard values should do the trick most of the time.

Sadly there is no GUI available because I'm too stupid for it.


Have fun!
